ip: 10.136.213.114
subnetmask: 255.255.252.0
gateway: 10.136.212.1
new dns server: 10.136.212.51 (our server)
Changed computer name (under system) to win1client
Changed domain to Domain1
restarted
**************************************************************************
changing win1client to winClient1 to match the naming scheme we had with winServer1
we also had to change the computer name in its settings to keep it matching winClient1
server side > created a group in Suzie called 'Remote' > added our users to the group
client side > local users > remote desktop users > properties > add > added 'Remote' group
when RDP into client as user, have to add 'domain1\' to the front of the user name, ie. - domain1\jrmartin
