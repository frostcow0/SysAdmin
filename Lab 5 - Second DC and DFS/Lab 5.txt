- Created folder on Server 1B that's shared with AccountingPeons
- Made several back steps so that we could rename the Parent folder of the shared folder to 'Data 2'
- Removed 'DOMAIN1\Users' from Security on C:\ drive. Could no longer read the folder, even when logged in as a user that was
a part of 'DOMAIN1\Administrators'. We re-logged in as administrator and un-did what we broke.
- Logged in as Alex on WinClient1 and added 'Data 2' as a network location to make sure that his access is working properly. It is.
- Adding 'DFS Namespaces' & 'DFS Replication' roles to each of the servers.
- Windows Searched 'DFS Management' because we couldn't find it.
- Reading internet tutorial.
- Right click Namespace, New Namespace, named it 'fileserver1.'
- Clicked 'Next' until it said done.
- Right click 'fileserver1,' New Folder, Browse for folder, adding 'Data.'
- Added 'Data 2' as a Folder Target to 'Data.'
- Went to Server 1B
- Added new Namespace called 'fileserver2.'
- Right click 'Replication' on 'DFS Management,' New Replication Group, Multipurpose Replication Group, Add both Servers as Members to
the group, Full mesh, added 'Data' as the replication folder, added local path of winServer1B's 'Data 2' to the replication folder.
- Don't need to set up schedule because we chose Continuous Update when setting up the group, or something.
- Accessed fileserver1 by going to the path \\domain1\fileserver1
- Alex is able to edit HR files now, completing defying Security logic. Not sure where to go from here.
- Spent the next 30 minutes trying to make Alex not able to edit the HR folder. Couldn't.
- Deleted Replication Group, scrapped old folders. Made a new folder in C:\ of winServer1 and added it as a folder to the namespace.
- Don't use replication group and it won't be a p.o.s.
